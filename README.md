# hello-world
The greatest repository that ever repositoried
I was once struck by lightning while working at a corral, it was the most intense and unusual sensation I never wanted to experience.
It's pretty cool that I didn't die, and I'm sure iti gave me superpowers that I just haven't discovered yet.
